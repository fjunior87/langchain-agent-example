# Change History

Implementation notes and fixes applied to the Harness Pipeline Agent project.

## Overview

This directory contains detailed documentation of significant changes, fixes, and implementations made to the project. Each document provides context, technical details, and lessons learned.

## Documents

### Fixes and Improvements

#### [Startup Fix](startup-fix.md)
**Date:** October 2024  
**Issue:** Application hanging during startup at "Initializing session..."  
**Solution:** Added `stdio` subcommand to MCP server parameters

**Key Changes:**
- Updated `mcp_client.py` to pass `args=["stdio"]`
- Added timeouts to prevent indefinite hanging
- Improved error messages

---

#### [MCP Stdio Fix](mcp-stdio-fix.md)
**Date:** October 2024  
**Issue:** MCP server not entering stdio mode correctly  
**Solution:** Proper MCP server command configuration

**Key Changes:**
- Fixed MCP server initialization
- Added proper context manager handling
- Improved connection reliability

---

#### [Tool Call Fixes](tool-call-fixes.md)
**Date:** October 23, 2024  
**Issues:**
1. JSON parsing error: `Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`
2. Pydantic validation error: `Input should be a valid dictionary`

**Solutions:**
- Added `_extract_mcp_result()` to handle MCP CallToolResult objects
- Updated Pydantic models to accept flexible types
- Added `_parse_intermediate_steps()` for structured tool call info
- Added `tool_calls` field to API responses

**Key Changes:**
- `agent.py` - Enhanced tool wrapper with logging and MCP result extraction
- `models.py` - Added `ToolCall` model and flexible `intermediate_steps`
- `main.py` - Updated endpoints to return `tool_calls`

### Feature Integrations

#### [LangSmith Integration](langsmith-integration.md)
**Date:** October 23, 2024  
**Feature:** Added LangSmith tracing for observability and debugging

**Implementation:**
- Part 1: Initial configuration and setup
- Part 2: Environment variable fix with `load_dotenv()`

**Key Changes:**
- `config.py` - Added 3 LangSmith settings
- `main.py` - Added `load_dotenv()` for environment variable loading
- Documentation - Comprehensive setup guide created

**Benefits:**
- Zero code changes to core logic
- Automatic tracing when enabled
- Complete execution visibility
- Token usage and cost tracking

## Common Patterns

### Problem-Solving Approach

Most fixes followed this pattern:
1. **Identify Issue** - Error messages, logs, user reports
2. **Root Cause Analysis** - Deep dive into the problem
3. **Solution Design** - Minimal, non-breaking changes
4. **Implementation** - Code changes with tests
5. **Documentation** - Detailed notes for future reference

### Code Quality Principles

- ✅ Minimal changes
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Well documented
- ✅ Properly tested
- ✅ No breaking changes

### Documentation Standards

Each fix document includes:
- Problem description
- Root cause analysis
- Solution details
- Code changes
- Testing instructions
- Lessons learned

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **MCP Server Communication**
   - Requires explicit `stdio` subcommand
   - Returns `CallToolResult` objects, not plain JSON
   - Needs proper async context manager handling

2. **LangChain Integration**
   - Reads directly from `os.environ`
   - Doesn't automatically use Pydantic settings
   - Requires explicit environment variable loading

3. **Pydantic Models**
   - Can be made flexible with `List[Any]`
   - `arbitrary_types_allowed` needed for complex types
   - Validation errors provide good debugging info

### Best Practices Established

1. **Always add logging** - Makes debugging much easier
2. **Document as you go** - Fresh context is valuable
3. **Test thoroughly** - Catch issues early
4. **Keep changes minimal** - Reduces risk
5. **Preserve history** - Learn from past solutions
